🔥 Firewall Configuration & Testing in Kali Linux (UFW)
This guide explains how to configure the firewall in Kali Linux using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) — including blocking and allowing ports, testing, and restoring the original state.

📋 Prerequisites
Kali Linux or any Debian-based Linux
ufw installed and enabled
Basic terminal knowledge
(Optional) telnet for testing
🛠 Step-by-Step Procedure
1️⃣ Install and Enable UFW
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw enable
2️⃣ Check Current Firewall Rules
List all active firewall rules with numbers:

sudo ufw status numbered
3️⃣ Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
sudo ufw deny 23
This blocks inbound traffic on port 23.

4️⃣ Test the Block Rule
Install Telnet if needed:

sudo apt install telnet
Test locally:

telnet localhost 23
Expected result: Connection refused or timeout.

5️⃣ Allow SSH (Port 22)
sudo ufw allow 22
⚠ Note: Always allow SSH before applying strict firewall rules, especially if connected remotely.

6️⃣ Remove the Telnet Block Rule
First, list rules:

sudo ufw status numbered
Then delete the Telnet block by its number:

sudo ufw delete 1
(Replace 1 with the actual rule number shown in your list.)

7️⃣ Commands Recap
# Install & enable firewall
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw enable

# Check firewall rules
sudo ufw status numbered

# Block port 23 (Telnet)
sudo ufw deny 23

# Test using Telnet
telnet localhost 23

# Allow SSH (Port 22)
sudo ufw allow 22

# Remove Telnet block rule
sudo ufw delete <rule-number>
📚 How Firewall Filters Traffic
A firewall filters network traffic based on rules:

Direction → inbound or outbound
Protocol → TCP or UDP
Port Number → service-specific (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP, 23 for Telnet)
IP Address → restrict by source or destination
If a packet matches a deny rule → dropped. If it matches an allow rule → permitted. If no rules match → default policy is applied.
